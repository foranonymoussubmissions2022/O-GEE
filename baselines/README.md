* The baselines contained in this folder are forks from their respective repositories. To run experiments in our setting first recreate the virtual environments and requirements as set by the authors. To prepare our datasets for the expected format of the baselines go through the [Data creation and preprocessing](https://github.com/foranonymoussubmissions2022/O-GEE/tree/main) step as detailed in the main README.md file.
* Then, to train DyGIE++ adjust the folder structure or change it in the dygiepp/training_config/ace05_event.jsonnet and run: ```scripts/train.sh model```. After the model has been trained run ```scripts/predict.sh model``` to generate output to be evaluated.
* To train Text2Event set the home_folder variable at the top of run_seq2seq_verbose.bash and  run: ```run_seq2seq_verbose.bash```after adjusting data file paths. After the model has been trained, run ```t2e.py``` to create the output files necessary for direct comparison to other models.
* For ASP, we have already adjusted the ```ere.conf``` file, however, to select whether the baseline should train on dbpedia or wikidata dataset, adjust the data_dir variable located in the file. After that, run ```data/training/asp/{dataset}/format.py``` and follow the instructions on the official repo.
